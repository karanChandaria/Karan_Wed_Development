     <ul type="circle"><li><p>India, officially the <strong> Republic of India </strong>(Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya) is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country, and the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west  China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.</p>

      <h3> <i> <b> <u> <strong>Ancient India </strong></u></i></b> </h3>
     <ul type="circle"> <li> <p>By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, 
        where they had earlier evolved.The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.
        After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures,
         and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan, Pakistan.
         These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,the first urban culture in South Asia,
        which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in what is now Pakistan and western India.Centred around cities
          such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, 
        and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production
         and wide-ranging trade.</p> </li></ul> <br> <hr>

         <ul type="circle"> <li> <p>According to consensus in modern genetics, anatomically modern humans first arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa 
            between 73,000 and 55,000 years ago.However, the earliest known human remains in South Asia date to 30,000 years ago.
             Sedentariness, which involves the transition from foraging to farming and pastoralism, began in South Asia around 7000 BCE.
              At the site of Mehrgarh, presence can be documented, with evidence of domestication of wheat and barley, rapidly followed
               by that of goats, sheep, and cattle.By 4500 BCE, such settled life had spread more and began to gradually evolve
                into the Indus Valley civilisation, which was contemporaneous with Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. This civilisation
                 flourished between 2500 BCE and 1900 BCE in what today is Pakistan and north-western India, and was noted for its
                  urban planning, baked brick houses, elaborate drainage, and water supply.</p> </li></ul> <hr>

         <ul type="circle"><li> <p>The Indian subcontinent, the great landmass of South Asia, is the home of one of the world’s oldest and most influential 
            civilizations. In this article, the subcontinent, which for historical purposes is usually called simply “India,” is 
            understood to comprise the areas of not only the present-day Republic of India but also the republics of Pakistan 
            (partitioned from India in 1947) and Bangladesh (which formed the eastern part of Pakistan until its independence in 1971). 
            For the histories of these latter two countries since their creation, see Pakistan and Bangladesh. <br><br>

         <ul type-="circle"><li> <p></p>Since early times the Indian subcontinent appears to have provided an attractive habitat for human occupation.
            Toward the south it is effectively sheltered by wide expanses of ocean, which tended to isolate it culturally
             in ancient times, while to the north it is protected by the massive ranges of the Himalayas, which also sheltered
              it from the Arctic winds and the air currents of Central Asia. Only in the northwest and northeast is there easier
               access by land, and it was through those two sectors that most of the early contacts with the outside world took 
               place. </p></li></ul>  <br>
